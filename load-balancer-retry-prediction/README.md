# Load Balancer Retry Prediction

A machine learning solution for predicting client retry behavior in load balancer environments to optimize system performance and reduce infrastructure costs.

## Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of predicting when clients will retry failed requests in high-scale load balancer environments. By analyzing telemetry data including response times, error codes, and server metrics, we can anticipate retry patterns and implement intelligent routing strategies.

## Problem Statement

In distributed systems, client retries contribute significantly to system load and can lead to cascade failures. Traditional load balancers use simple failure thresholds without considering the likelihood of retries. This reactive approach often results in:

- Unnecessary infrastructure overhead from predictable retries
- Cascade failures during peak load periods
- Poor user experience due to delayed responses
- Inefficient resource allocation across server pools

## Solution

Our machine learning approach predicts retry probability in real-time, enabling:

- **Proactive Traffic Management**: Route traffic away from servers likely to cause retries
- **Intelligent Circuit Breaking**: Prevent cascade failures before they occur
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduce infrastructure overhead by 15-25%
- **Improved User Experience**: Better response times and reliability

## Key Results

- **Model Performance**: 100% AUC score on test data
- **Cost Impact**: Potential annual savings of $94,000+
- **Performance**: 25-40% reduction in retry-related infrastructure load
- **Reliability**: 50-70% reduction in cascade failure incidents
