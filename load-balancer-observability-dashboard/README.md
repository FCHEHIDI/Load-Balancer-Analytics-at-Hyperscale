# Load Balancer Observability Dashboard

A comprehensive real-time monitoring and analytics platform for load balancer performance, reliability tracking, and infrastructure health visualization.

## Overview

This project provides a complete observability solution for modern load balancer environments, delivering real-time telemetry dashboards, anomaly detection, and performance analytics. The platform combines synthetic data generation, analytics processing, SQL data warehousing, and Power BI visualization to provide actionable insights into system health and performance.

## Problem Statement

Modern distributed systems require comprehensive monitoring to:

- **Track Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times, throughput, and error rates across server pools
- **Detect Anomalies**: Identify performance degradation and system stress before it impacts users
- **Analyze Retry Patterns**: Understand client retry behavior and its impact on infrastructure load
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Make data-driven decisions about server capacity and routing
- **Prevent Cascade Failures**: Proactively identify and mitigate potential system failures

## Solution Architecture

The platform consists of four main components:

1. **Data Generation Layer** - Synthetic telemetry data simulation
2. **Analytics Engine** - KPI computation and anomaly detection
3. **Data Warehouse** - SQL Server integration for historical data storage
4. **Visualization Layer** - Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring

## Key Features

- **Real-time Telemetry**: Live monitoring of load balancer performance metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated identification of performance degradation
- **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis and capacity planning insights
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Power BI integration for executive and operational views
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for high-volume production environments
- **SQL Integration**: Enterprise-grade data warehousing and reporting

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd load-balancer-observability-dashboard

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure database credentials
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your SQL Server credentials
```

### 2. Database Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your database credentials:

```env
DB_SERVER=YOUR_SERVER_NAME
DB_DATABASE=TrafficInsights
DB_AUTH_TYPE=Windows Authentication
DB_USERNAME=YOUR_DOMAIN\YOUR_USERNAME
```

**Security Note**: The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials and is excluded from version control. See `DATABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration instructions.

### 3. Run the Pipeline

```bash
# Run the complete observability pipeline
python src/observability_orchestrator.py

# Or run individual components
python src/data_generation.py
python src/dashboard_engine.py
```

### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run integration tests
python test_integration.py
```

## Core Components

### Data Generation (`src/data_generation.py`)

Simulates realistic load balancer telemetry including:
- Request logs with response times, status codes, and retry patterns
- Server metrics with CPU, memory, and throughput data
- Anomaly injection for testing alerting systems
- Regional and temporal traffic patterns

### Analytics Engine (`src/dashboard_engine.py`)

Processes raw telemetry to compute:
- Performance KPIs (P95/P99 latency, error rates, throughput)
- Anomaly scores and severity classifications
- Traffic distribution analysis
- Server health assessments
- Retry pattern analytics

### SQL Integration (`src/sql_injector.py`)

Provides enterprise-grade data management:
- Automated table creation and indexing
- Batch data insertion with transaction safety
- Historical data retention policies
- Query optimization for dashboard performance

### Orchestration (`src/observability_orchestrator.py`)

Coordinates the complete pipeline:
- Data generation scheduling
- Analytics processing workflows
- SQL data warehouse updates
- Error handling and logging
